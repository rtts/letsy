### Digital currency coupled to your email address

Letsy is a simple and safe currency for [Local Exchange Trading Systems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Local_exchange_trading_system). Everyone with an email address can send and receive Letsy's, no account needed. The system remembers the account balance for every email address, and after proving that an address is yours (using [nopassword](https://github.com/rtts/nopassword/)) you can sent Letsy's over to another account.
